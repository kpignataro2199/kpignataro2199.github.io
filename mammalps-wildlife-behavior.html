            <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>
            <p>Researchers in the Swiss Alps have introduced MammAlps, a multimodal video dataset designed to train AI to better recognize wildlife behavior[cite: 52]. Unlike traditional camera traps that are difficult to analyze at scale, MammAlps uses audio and scene context to create ecologically meaningful training data[cite: 53, 54].</p>
            <blockquote><strong>My take:</strong> This is game-changing for identifying behavior patterns that are easy to miss with the naked eye[cite: 59].</blockquote>
