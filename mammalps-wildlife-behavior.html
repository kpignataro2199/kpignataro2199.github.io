            <h2>Decoding Wildlife Behavior with MammAlps</h2>
            <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>

            <p>Researchers at EPFL and the Swiss National Park have developed <strong>MammAlps</strong>, a first-of-its-kind multi-view and multimodal dataset designed to train AI to recognize complex animal behaviors in the wild. Unlike standard camera traps that capture isolated clips, MammAlps uses nine overlapping camera angles and audio recordings to create a complete sensory snapshot of wildlife activity.</p>
            
            <p>The dataset includes over 14 hours of footage featuring species such as red deer, roe deer, and foxes. By labeling these behaviors at two levels—broad activities like <em>foraging</em> and specific actions like <em>sniffing</em>—the AI can build a real-time behavioral timeline for each animal. This level of detail is critical for understanding how animals interact with their environment and each other without human interference.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>My take:</strong> MammAlps represents a massive shift from simple species counting to true behavioral ecology. By using AI to "decode" these complex movements, conservationists can get faster, smarter insights into how factors like climate change or human presence are affecting the secret lives of these animals.
