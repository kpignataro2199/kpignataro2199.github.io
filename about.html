        <h2>About This Newsletter</h2>
        <p> Each issue highlights real tools, research developments, and practical applications of artificial intelligence that are shaping how we understand animals. From camera trap image recognition and behavior-tracking software to AI-assisted health monitoring systems, the goal is to examine not just what these technologies do, but why they matter.

As AI becomes more integrated into research and animal care settings, important questions emerge: How accurate are these systems? How do they change the role of human observation? And how can they be used ethically to improve welfare rather than simply increase efficiency? This newsletter aims to make those developments accessible, relevant, and grounded in real-world animal care and behavioral science.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, My name is Katelyn Pignataro. I am a senior majoring in Psychology with a minor in Digital Photography. My academic interests focus on animal behavior, cognition, and welfare, and I hope to pursue a career in animal behavior or training, ideally working with exotic or marine species.

Through some of the internship experiences I've had, I have spent time observing and recording animal behavior, learning firsthand how much patience, attention to detail, and interpretation goes into understanding even subtle movements or changes in routine. Those experiences have shaped how I view emerging technologies like AI. Rather than replacing human observation, I see AI as a tool that can support and enhance the work of researchers, caretakers, and behavior specialists.

This newsletter brings together my interests in behavior science, animal care, and technology to explore how applied AI is changing the way we study and support animals.</p>
