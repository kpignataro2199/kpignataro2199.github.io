            <h2>The $3 Billion Animal Health Market</h2>
            <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>
            <p>The AI animal health market is projected to reach $2.88 billion by 2029[cite: 73]. Key drivers include AI-powered wearables and smart monitoring devices that predict disease before symptoms appear[cite: 74, 75].</p>
            <blockquote><strong>My take:</strong> AI is already a practical part of animal care systems, not just a futuristic concept[cite: 78].</blockquote>
