            <h2>The $3 Billion Animal Health Market</h2>
            <p class="date">January 23, 2026</p>

            <p>The global market for AI in animal health is forecasted to grow to <strong>$2.88 billion</strong> by 2029, driven by demand for advanced diagnostic tools and smart monitoring devices. This trend reflects how applied AI is moving beyond just research labs and becoming more prevalent in commercial and clinical care settings.</p>
            
            <p>The growth is fueled by precision livestock farming systems and telemedicine solutions, ranging from wearables that track vital signs to tools that predict disease before visible symptoms may even appear. As investment grows, we can expect more tools that improve everyday animal health management for both pets and livestock.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>My take:</strong> While it may be easy to think of AI as something abstract or futuristic, this forecast shows how AI has already become a practical part of animal care systems. As these technologies emerge from their beginning stages, they will offer vital new data for researchers interested in behavior and wellbeing.
